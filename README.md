#  Ads Search

## Description

This project provides a website which user can search for ads matching with the keywords they input. We use fake data, generated by some code and also user-created ads. It support for basic CRUD operation but also, it requires some Machine Learning algorithms to match user attributes and ads attribute. Scheduled jobs will be run to fake some data and run algorithms to rerank current ads pool. It will also supports for business to register ads with a calculated price.
